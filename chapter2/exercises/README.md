Change the framing program so that it uses a different amount of space to separate the sides from the greeting than it uses to separate the top and bottom borders from the greeting.

# 2-3
Rewrite the framing program to ask the user to supply the amount of spacing to leave between the frame and the greeting.

# 2-4
The framing program writes the mostly blank lines that separate the borders from the greeting one character at a time. Change the program so that it writes all the spaces needed in a single output expression.

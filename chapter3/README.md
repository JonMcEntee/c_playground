# Chapter 3
Scripts and excercises from Chapter 3 of 'Accelerated C++' by Andrew Koenig and Barbara E. Moo.

# compute_grades_mean.cpp
Computes a students grade using their midterm, final, and homework scores.

# compute_grades_median.cpp
The same as compute_grades_mean, except the program computes the homework scores average using the median rather than the mean. This requires a slightly more complicated code.

// 3-6. The average-grade computation in ยง3.1/36 might divide by zero if the
// student didn't enter any grades. Division by zero is undefined in C++, which
// means that the implementation is permitted to do anything it likes. What
// does your C++ implementation do in this case? Rewrite the program so that
// its behavior does not depend on how the implementation treats division
// by zero

// NOTE: I solved this problem in the following way: if the user enters no
// homework grades, the final grade is simply calculated without homework
// included. So if there's no homework the final becomes 2/3rds of the grade
// and the midterm becomes 1/3rd of the grade. If the user enters homework
// grades, then the original ratios apply.
